## Technologies Used
### React
We used React to build-out our Front-end. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded.

### Rails
Rails is a server-side web application framework. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

### PostgreSQL
We used PostgreSQL as our database. It is a relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance.
